# haaska-go: Home Assistant Alexa Skill Adapter, but in Golang

This project does the same thing as [Haaska](https://github.com/mike-grant/haaska/), to set up you can follow the same [Wiki](https://github.com/mike-grant/haaska/wiki). The only difference is that it's written in [Golang](https://golang.org) instead of Python.

## What is the point of this?

There isn't one, really. I wrote it because I thought I could shave off a few milliseconds from my Alexa commands, because Haaska is written in Python and has some dependencies, and in theory a compiled language with all of the dependencies in the binary would be "faster".

That's not really the case, as it turns out [Python 3.7 is the fastest runtime on Lambda](https://medium.com/the-theam-journey/benchmarking-aws-lambda-runtimes-in-2019-part-i-b1ee459a293d) ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Maybe Go will get faster over time?

## Installation
